# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement LangGraph AI Analysis Orchestration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the LangGraph-based orchestration system for AI agents that perform compliance and risk analysis.
# Details:
Set up LangGraph framework for orchestrating AI analysis workflows. Create agent definitions for compliance gap analysis, risk assessment, control evaluation, and recommendation generation. Implement prompt engineering for each agent type. Build workflow definitions for sequential and parallel agent execution. Create caching mechanisms for intermediate results. Implement error handling and retry logic. Ensure all processing happens locally using the configured LLM.

# Test Strategy:
Test each agent type individually with sample inputs. Verify orchestration of complete analysis workflows. Measure performance and optimize as needed. Confirm all processing happens locally without external API calls.
