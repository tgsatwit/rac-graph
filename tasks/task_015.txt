# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Security, Privacy, and Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4, 9, 12, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the platform with security features, privacy controls, and performance optimizations.
# Details:
Implement data encryption for documents and analysis results. Create secure deletion functionality that purges all associated data. Optimize LLM inference for performance with large models. Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data. Create monitoring and logging for system performance. Develop error handling and recovery mechanisms. Implement database query optimizations for large datasets. Create system health dashboard for administrators.

# Test Strategy:
Test encryption and decryption of sensitive data. Verify secure deletion functionality. Measure LLM inference performance and optimize. Test system with large datasets to verify scalability. Verify error handling and recovery mechanisms.
