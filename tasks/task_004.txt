# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Vector Embedding and Semantic Search
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the system for generating and storing vector embeddings of documents and implementing semantic search capabilities.
# Details:
Integrate a local embedding model to generate vector representations of documents. Configure Pinecone vector database for storing and querying embeddings. Implement chunking logic to process large documents. Create API endpoints for semantic search functionality. Build UI components for search interface with filters for document types and categories. Ensure all embedding generation happens locally without external API calls.

# Test Strategy:
Test embedding generation with various document types and sizes. Verify semantic search returns relevant results. Measure search performance and optimize as needed. Confirm no data is sent to external services during the embedding process.
