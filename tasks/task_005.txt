# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Process Modeling Graph Database Schema
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the Neo4j graph database schema for representing business processes, risks, and controls.
# Details:
Define Neo4j node and relationship types for process steps, decision points, controls, risks, and other entities. Create database constraints and indexes for performance optimization. Implement CRUD operations for graph entities. Develop versioning mechanism for process models. Create API endpoints for graph operations. Ensure the schema supports all required process modeling features including loops, decision points, and control linkages.

# Test Strategy:
Test creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of graph entities. Verify that complex process structures can be accurately represented. Test versioning functionality. Measure query performance with large process models.
