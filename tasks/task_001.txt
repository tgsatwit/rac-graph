# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the monorepo structure with Next.js frontend, Neo4j database, and local LLM integration components.
# Details:
Create a monorepo using a tool like Turborepo or Nx. Set up the Next.js frontend project with TypeScript. Configure Docker containers for Neo4j graph database, Pinecone vector database, and local LLM (LLaMA) deployment. Establish connection configurations between all components. Set up development, staging, and production environments with appropriate environment variables.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all components can start and communicate with each other. Run integration tests to confirm the basic infrastructure is working. Ensure local LLM can be loaded and queried without external API calls.
