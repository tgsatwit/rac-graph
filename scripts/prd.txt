# Product Requirements Document

## 1 Purpose & Problem Solved
Organizations face challenges ensuring their business processes comply with internal policies and external regulations while minimizing risk. Manual compliance checks and risk assessments are time-consuming and error-prone, often leaving gaps in controls or missing opportunities for process improvement. This platform uses AI-driven analysis to evaluate business process documentation against relevant policies and regulations, identifying compliance gaps, assessing risk controls, and suggesting process re-engineering or automation opportunities.

## 2 Why It's Being Built
Organizations need to rapidly model their business processes and automatically evaluate them for compliance and risks. The platform will leverage AI to recommend stronger controls and smarter process optimizations, facilitating faster compliance reviews, proactive risk management, and continuous process improvement – all within a secure environment where proprietary data and AI models run locally.

## 3 Goals & Success Metrics
- **Compliance Automation**: 100% of uploaded business processes automatically checked against internal policies and regulatory obligations, with all compliance gaps highlighted using RAG status indicators
- **Risk Identification**: 95% of unmitigated risks correctly identified and mapped to organizational risk taxonomies
- **Actionable Insights**: Generate specific recommendations for addressing gaps in 90% of identified issues
- **Efficiency**: Reduce time spent on compliance reviews by 60% compared to manual methods
- **Collaboration**: Enable multiple users to work concurrently on process models with zero conflicts
- **Data Security**: Achieve 100% data sovereignty by keeping all processing local with no external AI dependencies

## 4 Elevator Pitch
Our AI-driven Process Compliance and Risk Management Platform enables organizations to rapidly evaluate business processes against policies and regulations, identify compliance gaps and risk exposures, and receive actionable recommendations for improvements—all within a secure, collaborative environment that keeps sensitive data within your control.

## 5 Target Users & Personas
1. **Admin**: Platform administrator who configures the system, manages knowledge bases, risk taxonomies, user accounts, and AI model settings. Integrates new models, sets up authentication, and oversees all projects.

2. **Risk/Compliance Analyst**: Primary user who creates and analyzes projects. Uploads process documentation, models business processes, and initiates AI analysis. Interprets findings and iterates on process design or controls as needed.

3. **Reviewer (Audit/Compliance Officer)**: Reviews process models and analysis results with read-only access. Verifies findings and approves recommended changes, ensuring controls and process changes adequately address requirements.

## 8 User Stories

### Admin Stories
- As an Admin, I want to upload and organize all relevant internal policies, regulatory documents, and frameworks, so that analysts have a comprehensive knowledge base for compliance analysis.
- As an Admin, I want to define the taxonomy of risks and controls along with the organization's risk appetite thresholds, so that the AI can align its analysis with our risk framework.
- As an Admin, I want to manage user roles and permissions (Admin/Analyst/Reviewer) across projects, so that access to sensitive data and editing capabilities are appropriately controlled.
- As an Admin, I want to select or change the AI model the platform uses, so that we can leverage improved models in the future or meet specific IT requirements.

### Analyst Stories
- As an Analyst, I want to create a new project for a specific business area or process, so that I can isolate its documentation and analysis from other projects while still accessing global reference knowledge.
- As an Analyst, I want to upload process documents in bulk, so that I can quickly set up the initial knowledge base for analysis without adding files one by one.
- As an Analyst, I want the system to parse uploaded process documentation into a draft process graph, so that I have a starting point that I can refine rather than modeling from scratch.
- As an Analyst, I want to visually edit the process flow using a drag-and-drop diagram editor, so that I can easily rearrange steps, add missing steps/controls, and define decision points or loops.
- As an Analyst, I want to validate the process model for correctness, so that I know the model accurately reflects the real process before analysis.
- As an Analyst, I want to run an AI-driven analysis on the modeled process, so that I receive a report of compliance issues, risk exposures, and improvement recommendations.
- As an Analyst, I want the analysis results stored and versioned, so that I can compare how risks/compliance gaps change as the process is improved over time.

### Reviewer Stories
- As a Reviewer, I want to view the process model and all related documentation in a read-only mode, so that I can understand the context before reviewing the AI's findings.
- As a Reviewer, I want to see a clear summary of compliance gaps and risk issues identified, so that I can focus on the critical areas that need attention.
- As a Reviewer, I want to see references to specific policies or regulations for each identified gap, so that I can verify the relevance and severity of the compliance issue.
- As a Reviewer, I want to add comments or approval flags on the AI's recommended actions, so that I can communicate which suggestions to implement or if further analysis is needed.
- As a Reviewer, I want to export the final compliance analysis report to PDF, so that I can share it with external auditors or save it as evidence of our compliance review.
