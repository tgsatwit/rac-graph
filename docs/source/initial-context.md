# Product Requirements Document: AI-Driven Process Compliance and Risk Management Platform

## Introduction  
Organizations today face increasing pressure to ensure their business processes comply with internal policies and external regulations while minimizing risk. Manual compliance checks and risk assessments are time-consuming and prone to error, often leaving gaps in controls or missing opportunities for process improvement. This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines a comprehensive platform that uses **AI-driven analysis** to evaluate business process documentation against relevant policies and regulations. The platform will identify compliance gaps, assess risk controls, and suggest process re-engineering or automation opportunities. By integrating a graph-based AI workflow engine with knowledge databases, the system will provide detailed insights and actionable recommendations to improve processes and controls.

**Product Vision:** Enable organizations to rapidly model their business processes and automatically evaluate them for compliance and risks, leveraging AI to recommend stronger controls and smarter process optimizations. The platform should facilitate **faster compliance reviews**, **proactive risk management**, and **continuous process improvement** – all within a secure environment where proprietary data and AI models run locally.

## Objectives and Goals  
- **Ensure Compliance:** Automatically check business processes against all uploaded internal policies, regulatory obligations, and industry frameworks. Highlight any compliance gaps or control weaknesses with Red/Amber/Green (RAG) status indicators.  
- **Risk Identification:** Map processes to organizational risk taxonomies to identify unmitigated risks. Ensure each step and control in a process is evaluated for risk exposure and alignment with the company’s risk appetite.  
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Provide clear recommendations for addressing gaps – including new or enhanced controls, required policy/procedure updates, or process modifications needed to meet obligations. Also suggest opportunities for **automation or AI-driven improvements** in the process.  
- **Efficiency & Collaboration:** Allow multiple users (analysts, reviewers, etc.) to **collaboratively** develop and refine process models in real-time. Streamline the onboarding of new processes through bulk document uploads and rapid configuration, enabling coverage of many business areas.  
- **Data Security & Privacy:** Support deployment in a **self-contained environment** with no external AI dependencies. The platform and AI models (e.g. Meta’s LLaMA) run on infrastructure controlled by the organization, ensuring sensitive data never leaves their environment ([Local Chat-LLMs and Data Privacy: A Practical Guide to Offline AI Interactions | by Asterios Raptis | Medium](https://asterios-raptis.medium.com/local-chat-llms-and-data-privacy-a-practical-guide-to-offline-ai-interactions-5af659a4f794#:~:text=In%20an%20age%20where%20data,businesses%20with%20strict%20privacy%20policies)). This is critical for industries with strict privacy or data residency requirements.  

## User Personas and Roles  
- **Admin:** The platform administrator who configures the system for the organization. Admins manage global settings such as knowledge bases (policies, regulations), risk and control taxonomies, user accounts, and AI model settings. They can integrate new models, set up authentication providers, and oversee all projects.  
- **Risk/Compliance Analyst:** The primary user who creates and analyzes projects. Analysts upload process documentation, model the business process (steps, decisions, controls), and initiate the AI analysis. They interpret the AI-generated findings and iterate on the process design or controls as needed. Analysts have edit access to their assigned projects and can view relevant global knowledge.  
- **Reviewer (Audit/Compliance Officer):** A user who reviews the process models and AI analysis results. Reviewers typically have read-only access to projects (or comment rights) and focus on verifying the findings or approving the recommended changes. They ensure that the proposed controls and process changes adequately address compliance requirements and organizational risk guidelines. The Reviewer may be a manager or an internal auditor providing sign-off on the analysis.

## Use Cases  
1. **Onboarding a New Business Process for Compliance Review:** An analyst sets up a new project for a business process (e.g. "Customer Onboarding Process"). They bulk-upload all related documents – standard operating procedures (SOPs), process maps, control descriptions, etc. The system ingests these and the analyst uses the process modeler to verify the flow. After validation, the AI agents analyze the process and produce a report of compliance gaps and improvements. The reviewer then checks this report and works with the analyst to refine controls.  
2. **Periodic Compliance Audit of an Existing Process:** For a process already in the system, a compliance officer triggers a fresh analysis (for example, after new regulations come into effect or policies are updated). The platform compares the latest process version against updated obligations and highlights any new gaps. It generates an updated set of required actions and recommendations, which the team uses to remediate the process.  
3. **Global Policy Update Impact Assessment:** The organization updates an internal policy or a new external regulation is added to the knowledge base. Admins upload the new/updated document (with versioning) and mark it as active. The platform can flag which existing processes might be impacted (via metadata linking processes to obligations). Analysts for each affected process receive notifications and can run the AI analysis to see what changes are needed for compliance with the new requirements.  
4. **Process Improvement and Automation Planning:** A business process owner wants to improve efficiency in a well-controlled process. They use the platform’s suggestions for automation – for example, the AI might identify a manual data entry step that could be replaced with an RPA bot or an AI service. The analyst and IT team review the suggestions for AI-based automation and decide on implementing a pilot solution.

## User Stories  
- **Admin Stories:**  
  - *As an Admin, I want to upload and organize all relevant internal policies, regulatory documents, and frameworks*, so that analysts have a comprehensive knowledge base for compliance analysis.  
  - *As an Admin, I want to define the taxonomy of risks and controls along with the organization’s risk appetite thresholds*, so that the AI can align its analysis with our risk framework.  
  - *As an Admin, I want to manage user roles and permissions (Admin/Analyst/Reviewer) across projects*, so that access to sensitive data and editing capabilities are appropriately controlled.  
  - *As an Admin, I want to select or change the AI model the platform uses (e.g. choose between a local LLaMA model or a different LLM)*, so that we can leverage improved models in the future or meet IT requirements.  
- **Analyst Stories:**  
  - *As an Analyst, I want to create a new project for a specific business area or process*, so that I can isolate its documentation and analysis from other projects while still accessing global reference knowledge.  
  - *As an Analyst, I want to upload process documents (SOPs, process maps, control catalogs) in bulk*, so that I can quickly set up the initial knowledge base for analysis without adding files one by one.  
  - *As an Analyst, I want the system to parse uploaded process documentation into a draft process graph with steps and controls*, so that I have a starting point that I can refine rather than modeling from scratch.  
  - *As an Analyst, I want to visually edit the process flow using a drag-and-drop diagram editor*, so that I can easily rearrange steps, add missing steps/controls, and define decision points or loops.  
  - *As an Analyst, I want to validate the process model for correctness (e.g., all branches have appropriate start/end, loops have exit conditions)*, so that I know the model accurately reflects the real process before analysis.  
  - *As an Analyst, I want to run an AI-driven analysis on the modeled process*, so that I receive a report of compliance issues, risk exposures, and improvement recommendations specific to that process.  
  - *As an Analyst, I want the analysis results stored and versioned*, so that I can compare how risks/compliance gaps change as the process is improved over time.  
- **Reviewer Stories:**  
  - *As a Reviewer, I want to view the process model and all related documentation in a read-only mode*, so that I can understand the context before reviewing the AI’s findings.  
  - *As a Reviewer, I want to see a clear summary of compliance gaps and risk issues identified*, so that I can focus on the critical areas that need attention.  
  - *As a Reviewer, I want to see references to specific policies or regulations for each identified gap*, so that I can verify the relevance and severity of the compliance issue.  
  - *As a Reviewer, I want to add comments or approval flags on the AI’s recommended actions*, so that I can communicate which suggestions to implement or if further analysis is needed.  
  - *As a Reviewer, I want to export the final compliance analysis report to PDF*, so that I can share it with external auditors or save it as evidence of our compliance review.

## Functional Requirements 

### 1. Knowledge Base Management (Policies & Obligations)  
**Description:** The platform will serve as a central repository for all reference documents that define compliance requirements and risk frameworks. This includes **internal policies**, **external regulatory obligations**, and **industry/global frameworks**. Users (Admins or Analysts with permission) can upload and manage these documents via the UI. Key capabilities include:  
- **Document Upload & Parsing:** Support uploading files in formats such as PDF, Word, Excel, or text. The system will extract text from these documents (using OCR if necessary for scanned PDFs) and index the content. No information is sent to external OCR services – all text extraction should use local libraries to maintain data privacy.  
- **Document Categorization:** Tag or label each document as *Policy*, *Regulation/Obligation*, *Framework*, etc., and further by topic or department if needed. For example, a document could be labeled "External Regulation – GDPR" or "Internal Policy – IT Security". These categorizations help in filtering and applying relevant documents to each project’s analysis.  
- **Version Control:** Allow multiple versions of the same document to be stored. Users can upload a new version of an existing policy or regulation. The system should maintain the version history (with timestamp and uploader notes), and allow marking one version as “active” for reference in analyses. Historical analyses should remain linked to the version of documents that was current at the time.  
- **Search and Retrieval:** Provide a robust search interface for the knowledge base. Users should be able to keyword search across all uploaded reference documents. This search will be powered by a combination of full-text search and semantic vector search (via Pinecone) for relevant snippets. For example, an analyst might search for “customer data retention policy” to find internal rules or regulations on that topic.  
- **Vector Embedding of Content:** All documents in the knowledge base will be broken into semantically meaningful chunks and embedded as vectors using an embedding model. These vectors are stored in the Pinecone vector database for fast similarity queries. This enables the AI agents to perform **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, pulling in relevant context from policies/regulations when analyzing a process ([Implementing Generative AI in Compliance: Challenges & Insights from Springs - Springs](https://springsapps.com/knowledge/implementing-generative-ai-in-compliance-challenges-insights-from-springs#:~:text=from%20providers%20such%20as%20OpenAI%2C,Chroma%2C%20Pinecone%2C%20Weaviate%2C%20and%20PGvector)). (Example: if a process deals with personal data, the agent will retrieve relevant GDPR or privacy policy clauses from Pinecone to check compliance.)  
- **Global vs Project-Specific Knowledge:** Documents in the knowledge base can be designated as “global” (applicable to all projects, e.g. enterprise-wide policies or external laws) or “local” to a specific business area/project (e.g. a departmental procedure that only that unit uses). The system should maintain namespaces or metadata to distinguish these. When an AI agent runs analysis for a given project, it should search the vector database in both the project’s own namespace and the global namespace, so that it doesn’t miss globally relevant obligations. However, it should clearly identify the source of any obligation (e.g. mark it as a global regulation vs. local policy in the output).  
- **Taxonomy of Obligations:** Optionally, allow Admins to organize obligations into a hierarchical structure or tags (for example, group obligations by regulatory domain or by risk category). This can help in mapping obligations to risks and in generating summaries like “Process X addresses obligations in categories A, B, but has gaps in C.” (This taxonomy might be stored in the graph database as part of the knowledge graph, linking documents to risk topics.)

### 2. Business Process Modeling and Management  
**Description:** The core of the platform is the ability to input and manage business process models for each project (business area or silo). A **project** represents a business process or a set of processes in a specific area. The platform will maintain a **graph model** of each process in Neo4j and provide a visual modeling UI for users to interact with this graph. Key features:  
- **Project Configuration:** An Admin or Analyst can create a new project, specifying basic info like project name, business unit, and optionally linking it to relevant global frameworks (for context). Creating a project initializes dedicated namespaces in the databases (e.g., a Neo4j subgraph labeled for that project, and a Pinecone namespace for any project-specific documents).  
- **Initial Document Ingestion to Graph:** When process documentation (e.g. an SOP or process description) is uploaded to a project, the system should attempt to **parse the process flow** from the text. Using NLP (potentially an LLM prompt engineering via LangChain/LangGraph), the system can identify sequences of steps, decision points, and control descriptions in the text. For example, if an SOP document enumerates steps 1, 2, 3… or a flowchart, the AI can extract those steps and any mentioned controls or responsible roles. These become nodes and relationships in the Neo4j graph: each **Step** (activity) is a node, each **Control** is a node, and relationships link steps in order and link controls to the steps they mitigate. This automatic parsing provides a draft process model for the analyst.  
- **Graph Data Model:** In Neo4j, represent key entities: **Process** (as a grouping node or label for the collection of steps), **Step** (with properties like name, description, owner role), **Control** (with properties like control type, description, existing effectiveness rating if given), **Decision** (a special kind of step that has multiple outgoing branches), and possibly **Risk** nodes (if specific risks are identified per step/control). Edges represent the sequence flow (Step A -> Step B), branching (Decision -> multiple Step outcomes), loops (an edge that goes back to a previous step indicating rework), and associations (Step “has control” Control X, Control “mitigates risk” Risk Y, etc.). This rich graph structure will later allow complex queries (e.g., find all steps with no controls, or find all controls that mitigate no risks).  
- **Visual Editing (React Flow Integration):** The front-end will provide a drag-and-drop process editor using **React Flow**. The graph from Neo4j is loaded and rendered as a flow diagram. Users can add new nodes by clicking or dragging from a palette (e.g., add Step, Decision, Control), connect nodes with arrows to define the flow, and annotate edges (e.g., label a rework loop with the condition that triggers rework). The UI should support common process modeling notation elements (at least informally), such as start and end nodes, decision diamonds (which can be represented by a special node shape), and loop-backs.  
- **Editing Node Details:** When a user clicks a process step node, they should see a sidebar or modal with the details of that step (from the Neo4j properties) and be able to edit fields: description, owner, any control references, etc. For a control node, they can edit control details (type, description, associated risk category, etc.). The UI may also allow linking an existing control node to multiple steps if one control applies to several parts of the process (to avoid duplicate control definitions).  
- **Validation of Process Model:** Provide a validation feature to ensure the graph is logically consistent. For example, check that every process graph has a clear start and end, every decision node has at least two outgoing branches and all branches eventually rejoin or end, loops are properly formed (no infinite loops without an exit), and each critical step has at least one control (this last one might be a warning rather than a hard rule, highlighting potential risk). The validation function can run automatically before allowing the AI analysis to start, ensuring the input graph is sound.  
- **Process Versioning:** Just as documents are versioned, the platform should version the process model. Major changes to the process (e.g., adding a new step or control) can increment a version, so analyses can be tied to specific process versions. Perhaps implement this by tagging nodes/edges with a version or copying the graph for major revisions. This helps in audit trail – you can always reproduce what the process looked like when a certain analysis report was generated.

### 3. Risk & Control Taxonomy and Governance Data  
**Description:** A key part of analyzing processes is understanding the universe of risks and controls and the organization’s appetite or tolerance for each risk type. The platform will include administrative interfaces to manage:  
- **Risk Taxonomy:** A hierarchical list or graph of risk categories (e.g., Strategic Risk, Operational Risk, Compliance Risk, etc., each with sub-risks). Admins can input this taxonomy or import from a standard (like Basel risk categories or COSO framework) as a JSON or CSV. This taxonomy will reside in the Neo4j graph as well (as a separate subgraph of Risk nodes related by "is subtype of" relationships). Each risk can have attributes such as risk description, inherent risk level, risk appetite (max acceptable residual risk), etc.  
- **Control Library:** A library of standard controls used in the organization, categorized by type. For example, controls might be labeled Preventive/Detective, Manual/Automated, and tied to certain risk categories (like "Access Control" mitigates "Unauthorized Access Risk"). Admins can maintain this list, including details like how to test the control’s effectiveness. When analysts model processes, they can reference these library controls or tag new controls with a type/category.  
- **Risk–Control Mapping:** The system should allow linking controls to the risks they mitigate. This could be done globally (in the control library, say Control X mitigates Risk Y) and/or at the process level (in the process graph, linking a specific implemented control to one of the risk nodes in the taxonomy). This mapping will help the AI determine if certain risks in the process lack controls, or if a control doesn’t clearly map to a risk (possibly an unnecessary control).  
- **Risk Appetite & Scoring:** Provide a way to input the organization’s risk appetite or scoring guidelines. For example, each risk category might have a rating scale (1-5) for impact and likelihood, and an acceptable threshold (like any risk scoring above a certain value must be mitigated to below that). The AI analysis can use this data to prioritize findings (e.g., highlight high risks that are out of appetite).  
- **Global Governance Data:** Other governance elements might include mapping processes to business objectives or regulatory requirements (e.g., tagging that a process is subject to SOX controls). Admins can manage such metadata so that analysis can consider them (for instance, if a process is tagged “SOX”, the absence of a certain key control would be a critical gap).  
- **UI for Taxonomies:** The platform should have an interface (likely in the Admin section) to view and edit the risk and control taxonomies. A tree or graph visualization could be used for the risk hierarchy. Admins can add new risk categories, edit names/descriptions, and delete or retire outdated ones. Controls can be listed with filtering by type or associated risk.  
- **Leverage in Analysis:** The risk & control taxonomy will be leveraged by AI agents during analysis to ensure thorough coverage. For example, if a process step is categorized under a certain risk area in the graph, the agent will consider all sub-risks in that category to check if controls exist. Conversely, if a control is identified, the agent can verify if it maps to the intended risks. This structured knowledge gives context beyond the raw text, helping the AI produce more contextually accurate and **deeply contextualized** insights by understanding relationships (which is an advantage of combining graph databases with vector-based AI ([Architecting a LLM-based RAG application Using Graph Databases | by Zia Babar | Medium](https://medium.com/@zbabar/architecting-a-llm-based-rag-application-using-graph-databases-688c54ff9d97#:~:text=This%20adaptability%20to%20complex%20relational,but%20are%20also%20deeply%20contextualised))).

### 4. AI Analysis Workflow (LangGraph Orchestration)  
**Description:** Once a business process model is in place (steps and controls defined, and validated), the platform can perform an in-depth analysis using AI agents. We will use **LangGraph**, an open-source framework for orchestrating complex AI agent workflows ([What is LangGraph? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langgraph#:~:text=LangGraph%2C%20created%20by%20LangChain%20%2C,of%20an%20AI%20agent%20workflow)). LangGraph allows defining a directed graph of tasks (sub-agents) that can operate in sequence or in parallel, passing information and maintaining state throughout the analysis. The AI analysis workflow will encompass multiple focused tasks, each performed by an agent or chain of LLM prompts. The high-level workflow:  

1. **Compliance Gap Analysis Agent:** This agent reviews the process steps and controls against the uploaded internal policies, external obligations, and frameworks. It uses retrieval from Pinecone to fetch relevant clauses (for example, if a step involves customer data, it will retrieve privacy policy sections). The agent then compares what the process does vs. what the obligations require. Output: a list of **compliance gaps** or non-conformities. Each gap should reference the specific policy/regulation requirement that is unmet (e.g., “Step X does not address requirement Y from GDPR Article Z”). This agent will mark each obligation as *Fully Met*, *Partially Met*, or *Not Met* (RAG status) in the context of the process.  
2. **Risk Exposure Analysis Agent:** This agent evaluates the process from a risk perspective. Using the risk taxonomy, it identifies which risks are inherent in the process steps (e.g., if a step involves manual data entry, there is an inherent risk of data error). It then checks the controls in place at each step and determines if the residual risk is within appetite. If a step has no control for a significant risk, that’s a gap. If a control is present but likely inadequate (perhaps flagged from historical control effectiveness data or by seeing it doesn’t fully address the risk scenario), it notes a concern. Output: an assessment of **risk exposures**, highlighting any *unmitigated risks* or *control gaps*. This might be represented as a table of risks with columns for inherent risk level, controls mitigating them, residual risk, and whether that is acceptable (yes/no).  
3. **Controls Efficacy Assessment Agent:** This agent specifically reviews each control linked in the process. It can cross-reference any control testing data if available (not in initial scope, but maybe notes about known issues with a control). It will also use the obligations and best practices to see if the control aligns with compliance expectations. For example, if a control is "Manager reviews all transactions weekly," the agent might flag if that control would not satisfy a requirement that “transactions must be reviewed daily” per policy. Output: an **evaluation of each control** – possibly rating them as Effective, Partially Effective, or Ineffective with justification. This overlaps with gap analysis but is more focused on the quality of controls.  
4. **Required Artifacts & Documentation Agent:** Based on gaps identified, this agent determines what additional policies, documents, or process steps are required to achieve full compliance. For instance, if the analysis finds that there is no documented procedure for handling customer consent withdrawal (required by regulation), it will output that *a new SOP or control needs to be created* to cover this scenario. Essentially, it generates a list of **missing artifacts or controls** needed. This could include things like “Document XYZ is required to address policy ABC” or “A formal control activity for verifying identity is required at Step 3 to meet the KYC obligation.” These outputs guide the organization on what to build or update.  
5. **Recommendations Agent (Enhanced Controls & Optimization):** This agent synthesizes the findings from the above and provides **recommendations** on how to improve the process and controls. This includes *enhanced or additional controls* – for example, suggesting an automated validation step if the current manual check is error-prone – and *process modifications* – for example, reordering steps to enforce a control earlier, or removing redundant steps that add no value. It will also consider **automation opportunities**: if certain tasks could be performed by software or AI, the agent will highlight them. For instance, “Step 5 involves manual data cross-check; consider using an RPA bot or an AI service to automate this, which would reduce error rates and strengthen control.” These suggestions aim to not only fix compliance gaps but also make the process more efficient and resilient.  
6. **Aggregation & Reporting:** A final step in the LangGraph workflow will aggregate outputs from all agents into a cohesive **Analysis Report** JSON structure. This will include sections for Compliance Gaps, Risk Analysis, Control Effectiveness, Required Artifacts, and Recommendations. The stateful nature of LangGraph means intermediate results can be shared between agents (e.g., the compliance agent might pass a list of obligations to the recommendation agent to ensure it covers them). LangGraph’s graph-based workflow ensures these sub-tasks can run and be combined in a controlled way, leveraging the transparency and state management that LangGraph provides for complex AI workflows ([What is LangGraph? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langgraph#:~:text=LangGraph%2C%20created%20by%20LangChain%20%2C,of%20an%20AI%20agent%20workflow)).  

**Key Characteristics of AI Analysis:**  
- The AI agents should provide traceability for their conclusions. For each gap or recommendation, the output will include references (which policy or risk it relates to). Where applicable, **citations to source documents** (internal policy or regulation text from the knowledge base) will be included in the analysis report to help users trust and verify the AI’s findings.  
- The AI analysis runs **locally** (within the organization's environment). The Large Language Model (LLM) performing reasoning can be a local deployment of LLaMA or similar. LangGraph can be executed in a server environment that has access to the LLM. The design will ensure no data is sent to external APIs for analysis; if using a model like LLaMA, it will run on the organization’s servers or specialized hardware. This guarantees compliance with data privacy – *“all interactions remain offline, eliminating external data transfer”* ([Local Chat-LLMs and Data Privacy: A Practical Guide to Offline AI Interactions | by Asterios Raptis | Medium](https://asterios-raptis.medium.com/local-chat-llms-and-data-privacy-a-practical-guide-to-offline-ai-interactions-5af659a4f794#:~:text=In%20an%20age%20where%20data,businesses%20with%20strict%20privacy%20policies)).  
- **Performance considerations:** Some analyses might be time-consuming (especially with large docs and complex processes). The system might execute these AI agents asynchronously (e.g., via a background job or cloud function) and inform the user when results are ready. A progress indicator or status (like “Analysis running…”) should be shown. Possibly break down tasks so partial results can be reviewed if needed (for example, compliance gap analysis might finish before recommendations agent starts).  
- **Extensibility:** The LangGraph workflow should be modular. New analysis agents could be added later. For example, a future agent could perform a **control cost-benefit analysis** or an **audit checklist generation**. The architecture should allow insertion of these without major changes to the pipeline, thanks to the graph workflow design.  
- **Validation of AI Output:** Implement a basic validation or sanity check layer on the AI outputs. For example, ensure that the recommendations agent does not contradict the compliance agent’s findings, or that all identified gaps have at least one recommendation addressing them. This could be a simple rule-based check or using consistency checks via a secondary LLM prompt. In future, integration of libraries like Guardrails or LMQL can be used to enforce output formats and correctness ([Implementing Generative AI in Compliance: Challenges & Insights from Springs - Springs](https://springsapps.com/knowledge/implementing-generative-ai-in-compliance-challenges-insights-from-springs#:~:text=7,on%20the%20project%E2%80%99s%20specific%20requirements)).

### 5. Collaboration and Real-Time Editing  
**Description:** To support teamwork, the platform will enable multiple users to collaborate on the process modeling and review in real-time. This includes:  
- **Concurrent Editing of Process Maps:** If two analysts are working on the same project, changes one user makes in the React Flow process diagram should propagate to the other user’s view almost immediately. For example, if User A moves a node or adds a new step, User B sees that update within seconds. This can be achieved by leveraging Firebase’s real-time capabilities or WebSockets. Specifically, the positions and properties of nodes/edges can be stored in a Firestore document that uses real-time listeners to update clients. We will implement optimistic UI updates to minimize latency in the user experience.  
- **Locking Mechanism:** To prevent conflicts, we may use a lightweight locking or intent system for nodes (e.g., if User A is editing the properties of Step 5, an indicator shows for User B to avoid editing that step until A is done). However, given Firebase’s real-time merge, we can also handle conflicts by last-write-wins and a history to undo if needed. In early versions, collaborative editing can be basic (it’s acceptable if rapid simultaneous edits occasionally override each other, as long as it’s rare and undoable).  
- **Comments and Annotations:** Provide the ability for Reviewers to leave comments on specific nodes or findings. For instance, a reviewer could click a step or a gap in the analysis report and add a comment like “Is this control sufficient given last year’s audit finding?”. These comments should be visible to analysts and allow a back-and-forth discussion. Real-time updates apply here so that a conversation can happen if both are online.  
- **Activity Feed / Change Log:** Maintain an activity log in each project that records significant events: e.g., “User X added step Y”, “User Z uploaded document Q (v2)”, “AI analysis run completed”, etc. This helps team members catch up on changes and also serves as an audit trail of who did what.  
- **Notifications:** If a user is assigned as a Reviewer on a project, they could receive a notification (in-app, or email if configured) when a new analysis report is ready for review or when an analyst mentions them in a comment. This ensures timely review cycles.  
- **Role-Based View Controls:** The UI will adapt based on role. Analysts get the full editing interface for process models; Reviewers get a view-only diagram (with perhaps a highlight on any parts that have associated findings). Admins get additional settings menus. Using role-based conditionals in the Next.js front-end, we will hide or disable controls that should not be available to certain roles (e.g., a Reviewer should not see the “Run Analysis” button if they are not meant to execute it).  
- **Global vs Project Collaboration:** Admins managing the global knowledge base might also benefit from real-time collaboration (though this is more likely a single-user task at a time). We will ensure that if two admins edit the taxonomy or global documents, changes also sync in real-time. For example, if one admin adds a new risk category, another admin on a different screen would see it appear.

### 6. Output Management and Reporting  
**Description:** The results produced by the AI analysis and the information in the process model need to be preserved and made accessible in various formats. Requirements for outputs include:  
- **Structured JSON Storage:** Every time an analysis is run, the platform will save the results in a structured JSON format in the database. This could be stored in a Firestore collection (e.g., `analyses` with documents containing the JSON for each run) or another database if more suitable. The JSON will include all sections of the analysis (compliance gaps, risks, controls assessment, recommendations, etc.), along with metadata like timestamp, which process version it was based on, and which LLM model was used. Storing as JSON ensures flexibility for future uses (we can easily transform it for different output formats or revisit it with new tools).  
- **Report Viewing in UI:** The front-end will have a **Report Viewer** that takes the JSON output and renders it in a human-friendly format. Likely as a multi-section report with headings and tables/lists for each section. For example, a “Compliance Gaps” section might be a table of obligations vs status (Met/Not Met) with details. A “Recommendations” section might be a list of recommended actions with sub-bullets for each suggestion. This viewer should allow Reviewers to scroll through and understand the analysis without dealing with raw JSON.  
- **Export to PDF:** Provide a one-click export of the analysis report to a well-formatted PDF document. This would use a server-side rendering (Next.js could use `getServerSideProps` or an API route to generate PDF) or a client-side library to generate PDF from HTML. The PDF should include the organization name, project name, date, etc., for formality. This is crucial for compliance evidence – companies might need to file or present these reports to auditors/regulators.  
- **Export to CSV/Excel:** For certain data (like a list of gaps or controls), exporting to CSV/Excel can be useful for further analysis or tracking in GRC systems. The platform should allow exporting relevant subsets in CSV. For instance, an export of “Gap list” with columns [Gap description, Severity, Related Regulation, Owner (to fix), Due Date] – the last two might be filled in later by users. Possibly allow the user to mark some fields before export or just export raw and let them fill externally.  
- **Integration APIs:** Beyond manual exports, consider providing APIs or integration hooks. For example, if the organization uses a GRC tool or Jira for tracking issues, the platform could expose an API to fetch the latest analysis JSON or even create items in another system. While full integration is future scope, designing the data model now to be integration-friendly is important.  
- **Historical Comparison:** In the UI, allow the user to select two analysis results (say version 1 vs version 2 of the process) and see what changed. This could highlight that initially 5 gaps were found, but after improvements only 2 remain, etc. This comparative view reinforces the platform’s value in showing progress over time.  
- **Dashboard:** Optionally, an aggregated dashboard for admins could show metrics like number of processes analyzed, total gaps identified vs resolved, compliance score per project, etc. This gives a high-level view of risk and compliance posture. (This is a stretch goal feature for visualization – not core to initial requirements but a nice addition if time permits.)

### 7. Administration & Configuration Features  
**Description:** In addition to the above functional areas, the platform requires various admin-level features to configure and maintain the system:  
- **User Management:** Admins can invite new users (or register them), assign roles (global roles and project-specific roles). A user may be an Analyst on one project and a Reviewer on another – the system should allow that level of assignment. Use Firebase Authentication for handling user identities initially (supporting email/password, and easily extendable to OAuth providers if needed). Ensure that all data calls enforce security rules so that, for example, an Analyst cannot access a project they’re not assigned to.  
- **Authentication & SSO Integration:** While Firebase Auth will be used for MVP (with its managed user store), the architecture must keep authentication modular. This means abstracting auth checks behind an interface so that later an enterprise SSO (SAML or OIDC via Azure AD, Okta, etc.) can replace Firebase. Password policies, 2FA, etc., should rely on Firebase features for now or be customizable if needed.  
- **Model Management UI:** An admin-only interface to manage AI models and settings. Initially, this will allow the Admin to select from available models: e.g., “LLM Provider” could be set to “Local LLaMA v2 13B” by default. In the future, this could list multiple models (if the system supports different models for different tasks, that could be configured here too). The admin can update the API keys or paths needed (for instance, if using a local model, maybe the path to the model weights or the URL of a local inference server). The UI should also allow testing the model (a simple prompt input to ensure the model is responding) and showing resource usage (if possible, like “GPU memory usage” if on local server – this might be more of an advanced feature).  
- **System Settings:** Admin can configure global settings such as: thresholds for risk ratings (if not already covered in risk appetite input), toggle features (like enabling beta features or not), and integration keys (like Pinecone API key, which index to use; Neo4j connection strings; etc.). Since we use a monorepo, these could also be environment variables, but a UI is more user-friendly for non-developers. However, sensitive things like API keys might be better managed via config files or environment and not exposed in UI for security. A balanced approach: the PRD expects that switching out Firebase or Pinecone later is possible, so perhaps keep such config in code for now but design it clearly for future change.  
- **Deployment & Scaling:** Although the platform is primarily designed for on-prem or single-organization deployment, note that an Admin might need to configure some deployment-specific settings (like number of AI worker threads, or enabling caching for embeddings). We won’t expose much of that in UI, but document how one would scale the system (for example, running multiple instances of the LangGraph analysis service if many analyses need to run in parallel). The architecture itself (Next.js + Firebase + external DBs) should support horizontal scaling (multiple front-end instances for multiple users; the vector DB and graph DB are external and scalable by their nature).  
- **Monitoring and Logs:** Provide Admins access to logs or status info. For example, show when the last Pinecone index sync happened, or if the Neo4j database connection is healthy. If an analysis fails, some error message should be available for troubleshooting. This could simply be access to Firebase function logs or a custom logs screen capturing exceptions from AI agents. For early versions, developers might check logs directly, but eventually exposing some of this to Admin UI is useful for transparency.  

## Non-Functional Requirements  
- **Security:** The platform must ensure that all sensitive data (process documents, policies, analysis results) is stored securely. Firebase Firestore rules will be configured to restrict data access by user role and project. Data in transit should be encrypted (HTTPS for all client-server communication). For data at rest, rely on Firebase/Firestore and managed services encryption. Additionally, Neo4j and Pinecone connections should be secured via encryption (Neo4j supports Bolt protocol with TLS, Pinecone uses API keys over HTTPS). The system will sanitize all inputs to guard against injection (especially since we store some user-entered text that might eventually be used in queries or prompts).  
- **Privacy Compliance:** If the platform is used in contexts with personal data in the documents, ensure compliance with data protection standards. Running LLMs locally with no external calls is a big part of this ([Local Chat-LLMs and Data Privacy: A Practical Guide to Offline AI Interactions | by Asterios Raptis | Medium](https://asterios-raptis.medium.com/local-chat-llms-and-data-privacy-a-practical-guide-to-offline-ai-interactions-5af659a4f794#:~:text=In%20an%20age%20where%20data,businesses%20with%20strict%20privacy%20policies)). We will also include features for data deletion: if a document is removed or a project deleted by an admin, all associated data (vector entries, graph nodes, analysis outputs) should be purged from the system upon confirmation.  
- **Performance and Scalability:** The app should handle multiple projects and large documents. Target being able to ingest at least 1000 pages of documentation per project and processes with 100+ steps. Pinecone, being a managed vector DB, can handle large volumes of vectors and still provide low query latency for retrieval. Neo4j can handle thousands of nodes/edges per process easily; we must optimize queries (using proper indexes in Neo4j for any key attributes we search by). The Next.js app should remain responsive during heavy analysis by offloading AI work to background tasks. We will implement caching where possible (for example, embedding vectors for a document only once and reusing if the doc hasn’t changed, caching AI answers for identical follow-up queries within a session, etc.).  
- **Usability:** The UI/UX should be intuitive for risk and compliance professionals who may not be tech experts. That means clear labeling of sections, guided workflows (maybe a step-by-step wizard to set up a new project), and helpful tooltips or documentation within the app. The use of Tailwind CSS with **shadcn/UI components** will ensure a modern, accessible design – consistent spacing, responsive layout, and standard components (modals, buttons, forms) that behave uniformly. Short paragraphs and sections in the report and on screens improve readability, aligning with best practices for not overwhelming users with text.  
- **Reliability:** The system should be resilient to errors in AI processing. If an LLM agent fails or times out, the system should handle it gracefully (perhaps try a retry or return a partial result with an error message in that section). All critical operations (document upload, saving process model, running analysis) should be transactional or have clear states, to avoid data corruption (e.g., avoid half-ingested documents or half-updated graphs). Use Firebase transactions for multi-step updates and Neo4j transactions for graph ops.  
- **Maintainability (Monorepo Benefits):** The project follows a monorepo structure, meaning front-end, back-end, and any shared libraries are in one repository. This ensures that changes across modules stay in sync (for example, a shared type definition for a Risk object can be used in both the Next.js app and in a Node.js analysis script). Using a tool like Nx or Turborepo will organize the code into packages: perhaps `/apps/frontend` for the Next.js app, `/apps/functions` for Firebase Cloud Functions (or a Node API server), and `/libs/*` for shared code (types, utilities, API clients for Neo4j/Pinecone). This structure improves maintainability by making sure there is a single source of truth for data models and enabling atomic commits across the stack.  

## Technical Architecture and Stack Details

### Overall Architecture  
The platform is composed of a **React/Next.js front-end** application, a set of **backend services** (initially on Firebase, possibly extending to custom servers), and integrations with specialized databases (Pinecone and Neo4j) as well as AI model services. The high-level design is as follows:  

- **Next.js Front-End (TypeScript):** Serves the web application UI. It will use Next.js for server-side rendering and client-side interactivity. All user interactions (uploading docs, editing processes, viewing reports) happen here. Next.js also provides API routes or can use Firebase Functions as backend endpoints for certain actions. The UI communicates with backend services via HTTPS (REST or GraphQL or direct SDK calls for Firebase). The front-end is styled with Tailwind CSS and uses pre-built **shadcn/UI** components for a consistent look and feel. Shadcn provides a set of accessible, theme-able components (like forms, dropdowns, modals) that work well with Tailwind, speeding up UI development.  
- **Firebase Backend:** The platform uses Firebase primarily for authentication and as a quick solution for hosting and serverless functions. Specific Firebase components:  
  - *Firebase Auth*: manages user sign-in, using email/password or OAuth as configured. We’ll enforce role-based access by storing user roles in Firebase (either in Auth custom claims or Firestore).  
  - *Cloud Firestore*: acts as a primary database for application metadata and small data. This includes user profiles, project definitions, references (not the large documents text), analysis result JSON, and collaboration state (like the latest process graph state for real-time sync, if we choose to store graph JSON here). Firestore’s real-time listeners power the live collaboration features. It’s also convenient for storing configuration (like risk taxonomy) in structured documents.  
  - *Cloud Storage*: stores raw uploaded files (PDFs, etc.) if needed. We might upload a PDF to Firebase Storage and then process it (extract text) server-side. The text content will then live in Pinecone (as embeddings) and possibly a copy in Firestore for search indexing. Storing original files is useful for downloads or reference.  
  - *Cloud Functions*: custom server-side logic. This includes invoking the AI analysis workflow. For example, when an analyst clicks “Run Analysis”, it could call a Firebase Function that orchestrates LangGraph agents (possibly by spawning a Python process or calling an API of a dedicated AI service). Cloud Functions will also handle heavy tasks like parsing documents into the Neo4j graph (running server-side because it might use an NLP library or LangChain). Using functions keeps sensitive operations secure and off the client.  

- **LangGraph AI Orchestration:** We will implement the AI agent workflow using LangGraph (likely in a Python service, given LangChain’s Python roots, though possibly it could be done in Node if LangChainJS supports similar logic by 2025). The LangGraph workflow could run as a separate microservice that our Cloud Function triggers (e.g., send a request to an AI service running LangGraph, which returns the analysis results). Alternatively, we might incorporate a Python runtime in the Firebase Function (though that complicates deployment). For modularity, envision a **dedicated AI Service**: a containerized service running Python, LangChain/LangGraph, connected to the Pinecone and Neo4j instances. The Next.js or Firebase backend calls this service via REST or gRPC when needed. This separation means we could scale the AI service independently if many analyses are queued.  

- **Pinecone Vector Database:** Pinecone is used to store and retrieve text embeddings for all documents. The application communicates with Pinecone via its API (from the backend services). When documents are added or updated, an embedding function (likely using an open-source model or a small remote call if absolutely needed) will generate vector embeddings for chunks of text. These are upserted into Pinecone with metadata like `{project: X, doc_type: policy, doc_id: Y, chunk_index: Z}`. During AI analysis or user searches, Pinecone’s similarity search is used to fetch the most relevant chunks given a query. Pinecone offers **fast, scalable similarity search**, which is crucial for performance when the knowledge base grows large ([Implementing Generative AI in Compliance: Challenges & Insights from Springs - Springs](https://springsapps.com/knowledge/implementing-generative-ai-in-compliance-challenges-insights-from-springs#:~:text=from%20providers%20such%20as%20OpenAI%2C,Chroma%2C%20Pinecone%2C%20Weaviate%2C%20and%20PGvector)). If an organization requires an on-prem solution, the architecture allows substituting Pinecone with a self-hosted vector DB (like an Elasticsearch vector index or the new Neo4j vector index) in the future, but Pinecone is the default for ease of use and reliability.  

- **Neo4j Graph Database:** Neo4j stores the structured process model and related knowledge graph elements (risks, controls mapping, etc.). The app will use the official Neo4j drivers (there’s a JavaScript driver) to query and update the graph. For instance, when rendering the process in React Flow, a query like `MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) WHERE n.processId = {projId} RETURN n, r, m` fetches the nodes and edges. When a user adds a node via UI, a mutation query runs to create that node and connect it. Neo4j may be hosted on-premise or in Neo4j Aura (cloud); for local deployments, the org can run a Neo4j server alongside. We will define appropriate indexes (e.g., on node labels like Step, Control) to speed up lookups. One reason for Neo4j is to leverage complex relationship queries and also possibly to incorporate graph algorithms in future (like finding the shortest path for a process variant, etc.). Importantly, combining the knowledge graph with LLM analysis allows more context – as research suggests, graph databases help provide relational context to LLM outputs for more precise and contextual responses ([Architecting a LLM-based RAG application Using Graph Databases | by Zia Babar | Medium](https://medium.com/@zbabar/architecting-a-llm-based-rag-application-using-graph-databases-688c54ff9d97#:~:text=This%20adaptability%20to%20complex%20relational,but%20are%20also%20deeply%20contextualised)).  

- **Integration of Graph and Vector in Analysis:** The AI agents will utilize both the Neo4j graph and Pinecone. For example, an agent might query Neo4j to get all steps without controls, then form questions to the LLM about those steps with relevant policy extracts from Pinecone. We may implement custom LangChain tools: one tool that given a Cypher query will fetch data from Neo4j, and another that queries Pinecone for text. The LangGraph workflow can thus have nodes that call these tools and feed the results into the LLM’s context window. This hybrid approach ensures the AI isn’t just generating answers from text in isolation, but is aware of the process structure and risk relationships.  

- **Monorepo Code Structure:** The project’s codebase is organized to facilitate this architecture. Likely structure:  
  - `apps/web`: Next.js app (React components, pages, API routes if any).  
  - `apps/functions`: Firebase Cloud Functions (Node.js code) for backend logic. Could also include a separate `apps/ai-service` if we have a distinct service.  
  - `libs/shared`: shared TypeScript code (interfaces for data objects like Process, Step, Risk, etc., so front-end and back-end use the same definitions; maybe utility functions for formatting).  
  - `libs/ui`: if we create custom React components, or wrap shadcn components for our use (like a preconfigured React Flow canvas, or a custom Node component for React Flow), we can put them here for reuse.  
  - We will configure build tools (Nx or Turborepo) to run linting, tests, and build all pieces. This ensures consistency. With Nx, we could even set up implicit dependencies (if schema changes in shared lib, rebuild functions and web, etc.).  
  - This setup also eases future replacement of Firebase: for instance, if moving to an Express server, we can create `apps/server` and shift logic from `functions` over, while keeping the same shared libs for data models.  

- **Tailwind & shadcn in Design:** All UI will adhere to a design system built on Tailwind CSS utility classes for quick layout and styling. The **shadcn UI** components (which are basically pre-built components using Radix UI under the hood, styled with Tailwind) will be used for things like modals (e.g., confirm dialog on delete), dropdowns (for selection menus, e.g., choosing a risk category for a control), and forms (for editing properties). This provides a consistent base style (likely the “New York” default theme from shadcn) which can be theme-tuned. We’ll ensure color-coding for RAG statuses (Green for compliant, Amber for partial, Red for gap) is applied consistently in text and icons. Tailwind will help enforce responsiveness so the app works on various screen sizes (though primarily desktop use is expected for complex modeling, we will still ensure it doesn’t break on smaller screens).  

### Example Workflow Illustration (Architecture in Action)  
**(This section provides a narrative of how the components interact for a typical operation, tying the architecture together.)**

- An Analyst logs in via the Next.js app – Firebase Auth verifies credentials and issues an ID token. The Next.js front-end uses this token to authenticate subsequent calls (e.g., in headers for API requests or automatically via Firebase SDK).  
- The Analyst creates a new project “Customer Onboarding”. A request is sent to a Firebase Function (or Next.js API) which writes a new Project entry in Firestore, a new node in Neo4j (Project node), and initializes a Pinecone namespace. The front-end is updated to show the empty process canvas.  
- The Analyst uploads three documents (two PDFs and one DOCX). The files go into Firebase Storage, and a Cloud Function triggers to process them. The function extracts text (perhaps using a library like Apache Tika or pdf.js for PDFs, and a docx parser). It then calls an embedding model (if we have an embedding service or using Pinecone’s on-the-fly embedding) to vectorize chunks and upsert to Pinecone under namespace “Customer Onboarding”. It also sends the raw text to a LangChain routine that tries to parse a process (maybe using regex for steps or asking an LLM: “Extract a list of steps from this text”). The extracted steps are then saved to Neo4j as a sequence of Step nodes with relationships. The control info in text (like “Control: Manager approval”) is also saved as Control nodes linked to the relevant steps.  
- The Analyst opens the process modeler UI. The React Flow component queries the backend (via an API that runs a Neo4j query) to get all nodes and edges for “Customer Onboarding” process. It then renders the flowchart. The analyst sees that it mostly captured the process, but perhaps adds a missing decision node and a control. When they add these in the UI, the app calls an update API that writes to Neo4j (creating new nodes and relationships). The real-time sync broadcasts this change to any other viewer (e.g., if a Reviewer was online watching, they’d see the node added).  
- The Analyst clicks “Validate” and the system runs checks (some on frontend, some via an API that runs more complex checks in Neo4j). Suppose everything passes or minor warnings are shown (which the analyst can override if acceptable). Now they click “Run Analysis”.  
- This triggers the AI analysis pipeline. The front-end calls a Cloud Function `runAnalysis(projectId)`. This function (Node.js) could simply forward the request to the Python AI service (if we have it separate) or directly execute a Python script via a child process. The LangGraph-defined workflow kicks off:  
  - It queries Neo4j (via the Neo4j Python driver) for necessary context: e.g., list of steps and controls, and any linked risk categories.  
  - It uses Pinecone’s Python client to create retriever objects for the global and project knowledge base.  
  - Each agent in the LangGraph workflow (as described earlier) runs: for instance, the compliance agent formulates a prompt like “Given the following process steps and controls..., and the following relevant policy excerpts..., identify gaps...” where the policy excerpts are fetched by embedding queries (Pinecone similarity search).  
  - The LLM (running locally, perhaps via the `llama.cpp` library or an API to a local server hosting the model) processes the prompt and returns a response. LangChain frameworks structure these calls and parse outputs as needed.  
  - Intermediate results are stored in the LangGraph state and can be passed to subsequent agents. After all sub-agents complete, the final structured result is assembled.  
- The Cloud Function receives this result (as a Python return or via polling the job if async). It then writes the result JSON to Firestore (under something like `analyses/{projectId}/{analysisId}`) and also returns a response to the front-end that analysis is complete. (If it’s a long running job, we might instead use a webhook or update a status in Firestore that the front-end is listening to.)  
- The Analyst’s UI, upon completion, navigates to the Analysis Report view, loading the latest report from Firestore. They can now explore the findings. The UI could highlight on the process diagram itself where gaps are (e.g., border a step in red if a gap relates to that step, such as missing control). The Analyst reviews and then notifies the Reviewer.  
- The Reviewer logs in, reads the report (the UI for them is read-only and maybe has an “Approve” button for each recommendation). They export the PDF for record. They might comment on a particular recommendation if they want adjustments. The Analyst addresses comments by perhaps tweaking the process or asking the AI to rerun a specific agent with new info.  
- All these interactions are logged. The project now shows as having an analysis on date X with Y gaps, of which Y1 are resolved after changes, etc. Over time, the organization can onboard more processes repeating this architecture flow.

### Technology Choices Justification  
- **Next.js and TypeScript:** Provides a robust framework for building a scalable front-end (and some back-end via API routes). SSR can be useful for initial load performance and SEO (though SEO is not a major concern for an internal tool). TypeScript ensures type safety across the codebase, which is crucial in a large project with many data structures (reducing runtime errors).  
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/UI:** Tailwind allows rapid UI development with utility classes and easy theming. shadcn/UI gives a set of accessible components which saves time on building common UI patterns from scratch. This combination ensures the UI can be both quickly developed and easily maintained/styled.  
- **Firebase (Modular Backend):** Firebase was chosen to accelerate development (managed auth, real-time DB, serverless functions hosting). It removes the need to set up a separate auth service or WebSocket server for collaboration. By keeping the Firebase integration modular (i.e., not writing business logic that is too tied to Firestore queries or Firebase-specific features), we maintain the flexibility to swap it out. For example, if in the future the product needs on-prem deployment without Google Cloud, we could replace Firebase Auth with Keycloak/Okta and Firestore with an alternate DB. The monorepo and layered architecture means our core logic (analysis, etc.) is not tightly coupled to Firebase.  
- **LangGraph & Pinecone & Neo4j:** This trio is at the heart of the intelligent analysis capability. **LangGraph** is chosen over a simpler sequential approach because it provides a structured way to manage multiple AI agents and their dependencies, which matches our requirement of a multi-step analysis. It leverages graph-based workflow design for AI, offering better transparency of state and easier debugging of complex agent interactions ([What is LangGraph? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langgraph#:~:text=LangGraph%2C%20created%20by%20LangChain%20%2C,of%20an%20AI%20agent%20workflow)). **Pinecone** is a production-ready vector database, ideal for retrieval tasks on embeddings; using it out-of-the-box means we rely on a tested solution for the RAG pattern, focusing our effort on domain logic rather than vector search algorithms. **Neo4j** is a natural fit for representing process flows and their interconnections (steps, controls, risks). Graph queries and algorithms can be very powerful for things like impact analysis (e.g., if a control fails, what risks are affected? Traverse the graph to find downstream nodes). Additionally, graph databases complement vector stores by adding relational knowledge that pure embedding search might miss ([Architecting a LLM-based RAG application Using Graph Databases | by Zia Babar | Medium](https://medium.com/@zbabar/architecting-a-llm-based-rag-application-using-graph-databases-688c54ff9d97#:~:text=This%20adaptability%20to%20complex%20relational,but%20are%20also%20deeply%20contextualised)).  
- **Local LLM (LLaMA):** We target the ability to run the LLM locally on commodity hardware or dedicated servers with GPUs. LLaMA models (especially LLaMA 2 13B or 30B) can achieve reasonable performance for text analysis tasks. By 2025, optimized runtimes (like Llama.cpp or others) allow these models to run with fewer resources. This gives the organization **complete data sovereignty** and compliance with security standards by not sending data to third-party AI APIs ([Local Chat-LLMs and Data Privacy: A Practical Guide to Offline AI Interactions | by Asterios Raptis | Medium](https://asterios-raptis.medium.com/local-chat-llms-and-data-privacy-a-practical-guide-to-offline-ai-interactions-5af659a4f794#:~:text=In%20an%20age%20where%20data,businesses%20with%20strict%20privacy%20policies)). If needed, the platform could also integrate with other models (the architecture could allow pointing to an Azure OpenAI endpoint or similar, behind the scenes) but the primary mode is offline.  
- **Monorepo and DevOps:** Using a monorepo fosters a **unified development workflow**. For instance, one can run `nx serve web` to launch the Next app and `nx serve functions` to run cloud functions locally for testing. Atomic commits ensure that if a data model changes (say we add a new field in the Risk object), we update both front and back end in one go, avoiding inconsistency. For deployment: we can have a CI pipeline that tests and lints all packages. Deployment could involve deploying the Next.js app (possibly to Vercel or Firebase Hosting) and Firebase Functions via Firebase CLI. The Neo4j and Pinecone services would be configured in environment variables. For local/on-prem deployment, we’d provide Docker or Terraform scripts to spin up the Next.js app (in Node server mode), the AI service, a Neo4j container, etc., to make it as turnkey as possible.  

## Diagram  
*(Diagram depicting the high-level architecture with components: omitted in text-only format, but would illustrate how the Next.js app connects to Firebase (Auth, Firestore), to Neo4j, to Pinecone, and how the LangGraph AI workflow service sits alongside communicating with Pinecone/Neo4j and being triggered by the app.)*  

**Figure: Platform Architecture Overview.** The web client (Next.js) interacts with cloud services (Firebase for Auth/DB, Pinecone for vector search, Neo4j for graph data). The AI Workflow (LangGraph) can be thought of as a background worker that communicates with Pinecone and Neo4j to perform the heavy analysis and then returns results to be stored and displayed.

## Conclusion  
This PRD specifies a feature-rich platform that leverages state-of-the-art AI and robust software architecture to tackle the challenge of business process compliance and optimization. By combining a knowledge graph, vector similarity search, and AI agent orchestration, the platform will provide deep insights into where processes fall short and how to improve them. The use of a modern tech stack (Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript, Firebase) accelerates development and ensures a smooth user experience, while keeping the design flexible for future growth (modular backend, pluggable AI models, scalable databases). 

By implementing these requirements, we aim to deliver a tool that not only helps organizations stay compliant with ever-changing regulations but also drives them toward **process excellence** through intelligent automation suggestions. The end result will be a safer, more efficient enterprise where compliance and innovation go hand in hand, supported by a solid technical foundation. 

**Sources:** The design and approach are informed by best practices in AI-assisted compliance and process management, including Retrieval Augmented Generation techniques ([Implementing Generative AI in Compliance: Challenges & Insights from Springs - Springs](https://springsapps.com/knowledge/implementing-generative-ai-in-compliance-challenges-insights-from-springs#:~:text=from%20providers%20such%20as%20OpenAI%2C,Chroma%2C%20Pinecone%2C%20Weaviate%2C%20and%20PGvector)), the use of graph databases for contextual knowledge ([Architecting a LLM-based RAG application Using Graph Databases | by Zia Babar | Medium](https://medium.com/@zbabar/architecting-a-llm-based-rag-application-using-graph-databases-688c54ff9d97#:~:text=This%20adaptability%20to%20complex%20relational,but%20are%20also%20deeply%20contextualised)), and the importance of keeping AI processing local for privacy ([Local Chat-LLMs and Data Privacy: A Practical Guide to Offline AI Interactions | by Asterios Raptis | Medium](https://asterios-raptis.medium.com/local-chat-llms-and-data-privacy-a-practical-guide-to-offline-ai-interactions-5af659a4f794#:~:text=In%20an%20age%20where%20data,businesses%20with%20strict%20privacy%20policies)). The LangGraph framework’s capabilities ([What is LangGraph? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langgraph#:~:text=LangGraph%2C%20created%20by%20LangChain%20%2C,of%20an%20AI%20agent%20workflow)) have guided the multi-agent workflow structure proposed. These foundations ensure the platform is built on proven concepts tailored to the organization's specific needs.
