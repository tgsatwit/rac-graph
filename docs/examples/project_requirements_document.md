# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

**Purpose & Problem Solved:**\
This project entails creating a modern website that acts as a dual-purpose platformâ€”showcasing personal projects spanning web design, software development, and creative tech, while also providing an authenticated space for fellow users to capture and organize inspiration. The site solves the problem of fragmented project presentation by offering a centralized and cohesive platform to display a multitude of ongoing work, facilitating easier exploration and understanding of the creator's skills and innovative capabilities.

**Why It's Being Built:**\
The main objectives are to enable a professional presentation of diverse projects and to support a community of like-minded individuals in organizing their creative inspirations, especially for app development. Success will be measured by user engagement, ease of navigation, and an increase in collaborative ideation within the authenticated section. The project aims to present an innovative and tech-savvy image, drawing attention from fellow developers, designers, and potential collaborators.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope Features:**

*   A sleek, modern website to showcase a variety of projects, including interactive web applications and UI/UX designs.
*   An authenticated section for users to create, edit, and categorize their ideas or notes.
*   Ability for users to bookmark, tag, and organize inspiration (e.g., images, links) into collections.
*   Implementing search functionality for easy retrieval of saved inspiration content.
*   User roles for regular and authenticated users, providing controlled access to features.
*   Adherence to accessibility standards (WCAG) and mobile responsiveness.
*   Integration of user authentication, potentially via Firebase Authentication.

**Out-of-Scope Features:**

*   Monetization features such as advertisements or premium accounts in the initial launch.
*   Advanced collaborative features within the ideation section, such as shared collections or discussion spaces, planned for future implementation.
*   Integrating third-party APIs beyond basic user authentication in the first version.

## 3. User Flow

A regular user visits the website and navigates through a portfolio of various showcased projects, capturing both the creative and technical aspects of the work. The main navigation page presents the projects using a modern and minimalistic design style. Users can freely explore content related to software development and design, gaining insights into different project endeavors presented by the site owner.

Upon choosing to sign up or log in, a user gains access to an exclusive authenticated section dedicated to inspiration capturing. Here, the user can create new notes or ideas, categorize them with tags or within folders, and save external links or images. This section's design offers intuitive usability, with a search feature to locate specific pieces of inspiration quickly. Users can manage their inspirations, updating and organizing their ideas as needed.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Project Showcase:** Visually engaging presentation of diverse tech and creative projects.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up/login system ensuring controlled access to advanced features.
*   **Inspiration Management:** Features for creating, categorizing, and organizing notes and content.
*   **Tagging & Search:** Allow users to tag and easily retrieve specific content with a search function.
*   **Responsive Design:** Mobile and desktop responsive interface ensuring accessibility across devices.
*   **Accessibility Compliance:** Following WCAG guidelines for inclusive access to website features.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend Framework:** Likely React or a similar framework, enhanced by V0 by Vercel for modern design implementation.
*   **Backend Systems:** User authentication possibly managed by Firebase.
*   **Database & Storage:** Integrated database systems to store user data and inspiration content.
*   **IDE & Development Tools:** Development using IDEs like Cursor AI and Replit for real-time code suggestions and team collaboration.
*   **AI Model Usage:** Claude AI and Lovable for intelligent coding assistance and rapid project setup.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** Website should load and render pages quickly, especially the portfolio content.
*   **Security:** Secure handling of user credentials and inspiration data, possibly through TLS/SSL encryption.
*   **Compliance:** Must adhere to general data protection regulations and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Tool Dependency:** Relies on specific AI-powered tools and IDEs like Claude AI, V0 by Vercel, and others for project creation and component building.
*   **Technology Familiarity:** Assumes proficiency with tools and technologies like Firebase and modern frontend frameworks.
*   **Platform Availability:** Assumes continuous availability and support for third-party services like Firebase Authentication for smooth operation of user authentication features.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Limitations:** Potential rate limits on third-party APIs if those are used in future phases.
*   **Scalability Concerns:** Designing a system architecture that can efficiently handle increased load as user interaction grows.
*   **Design Consistency:** Maintaining the intended design aesthetics across a wide range of devices and browsers.

This PRD serves as a comprehensive blueprint guiding the AI models in developing a detailed technical framework and user-friendly features for the project, ensuring clarity and precision throughout the implementation phases.
